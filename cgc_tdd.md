# Card Games Converter (CGC) - Technical Design Document

# Description

The "Card Games Converter" (CGC) is a utility for converting pictures of cards into a printable format.

# Technologies

* Python 3.6
    * falcon
* imagemagick
* Linux

# API

* v1
    * /resize/ = POST. Upload a picture, convert it's size, and download the converted picture.
        * height and width  = Specify a different physical size. The default is 2.5 inches high and 3.5 inches wide.

# Functions

* image_info = Find the resolution dimensions of an image.
    * Input
        * image_path (str) = The full path to an image.
    * Output
        * height (int)
        * width (int)
* calc_ppi = Calculate and return the PPI for an image based on it's height and width.
    * Input
        * image_dimensions (list) = The resolution height and width of an image.
    * Ouput
        * ppi (int) = The pixels per inch density.
* convert = Execute the `convert` ImageMagick command.
    * Input
        * convert_cmd_args (list) = A list of arguments for the `convert` command.
    * Ouput
        * cmd_return (dict)
            * rc (int) = Return code.
            * stdout (str) = Standard output.
            * stderr (str) = Standard error.
* convert_image_density = Convert a single image to a specific physical size density based on the PPI.
    * Input
        * image_path_src (str) = The full path to the source image to convert.
        * image_path_dest (str) = The full path to the destination image to save as.
        * ppi (int) = The desired pixels per inch density.
    * Ouput
        * boolean = If this method was successful.
* find_first_image = Locate the first image in a directory.
    * Input
        * images_dir (str) = The images directory to search in.
    * Output
        * first_image (str) = The first image found.
* convert_rotate = Rotate an image.
    * Input
        * image_path (str) = The full image path to use.
    * Ouput
        * boolean = If this method was successful.
* image_rotate_by_dimensions = Rotate an image if the width is greater than the height. This allows for stacking of images for a printable page of 8 cards.
    * Input
        * image_path (src) = The full path to the image.
    * Ouput
        * boolean = If this method was successful.
* convert_merge = Merge one or more images together either vertically or horizontally.
    * Input
        * convert_merge_method (str) = Append the images together in the "vertical" or "horizontal" direction
        * images_paths (list) = A list of all of the full image paths to append together.
        * merged_image_name (str) = The full image path where the result will be saved to.
    * Ouput
        * boolean = If this method was successful.
* convert_batch_individual = Convert a batch of individual images into a format that can be properly appended. These will be rotated (if necessary) and have their PPI density changed.
    * Input
        * images_dir (str) = The directory of images that should be processed.
    * Ouput
        * boolean = If this method was successful.
* convert_batch_append_all = Batch convert all individual images into printable pages.
    * Input
        * None
    * Ouput
        * boolean = If this method was successful.

# Milestones

* 1.0.0 = All required functions are written and working.
* 1.1.0 = Tests are written and all relevant exceptions are added to the code.
* 1.2.0 = Programs works as a CLI utility with arguments.
* 1.3.0 = Caching is supported. Processing of individual images can be skipped by comparing the original and processed images with a SHA256 checksum.
* 1.4.0 = Parallel processing is added.
* 1.5.0 = Pip package support.
* 2.0.0 = API v1 is implemented.

# Development Time

* VERSION, TIME ESTIMATED (HOURS), TIME ACTUAL (HOURS)
* 1.0.0, 40, 20
* 1.1.0, 8
* 1.2.0, 8
* 1.3.0, 4
* 1.4.0, 8
* 1.5.0, 4
