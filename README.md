# Card Games Converter (CGC)

This program is used to batch convert standard 2.5 by 3.5 inches cards into a printable format. Each card in the `/tmp/cards/` directory will be rotated, have it's pixel per inch density changed to be the actual physical card size, and then combine up to 8 cards per page to print. The completed images are saved to `/tmp/cgc/horizontal/`.

This is aimed for use with independent and free card games that are intended for personal use.
