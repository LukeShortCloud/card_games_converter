# Card Games Converter (CGC)

This program is used to batch convert standard 2.5 by 3.5 inches cards into a printable format. Each card in the `/tmp/cards/` directory will be rotated, have it's pixel per inch density changed to be the actual physical card size, and then combine up to 8 cards per page to print. The completed images are saved to `/tmp/cgc/horizontal/`.

This is aimed for use with independent and free card games that are intended for personal use.

## Installation

Install ImageMagick and Python 3 on a Linux system.

Stable CGC releases can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/ekultails/card_games_converter/releases).

## Usage

Example Python code:

```
#!/usr/bin/python3

from cgc import CGC


cgc = CGC()
cgc.convert_batch_append_all()
```

* Create the directory `/tmp/cards/`.
* Copy individual images of cards to that directory.
* Execute the CGC program.
* Print the resulting pages from `/tmp/cgc/horizontal/`.
